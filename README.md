-   Using node v22.2.0, javascript, typescript, and jest
    -   Using 3rd party package for prompt
    -   `.prettierrc.json` file included to work with my personal code style formatting
-   To run the code, first pull the code and run `npm i`
-   After installing node_modules, `npm start` will run the program
    -   `prompt: text:` enter any line of text in the console with as many spaces between words
    -   `prompt: number:` enter the number of spaces added between words
        -   Error handling includes:
            -   If number is not an integer or less than 1
